            <p style=text-align:left>     Hi there! My name is Adam Paul, and I'm a junior-year Software Engineering major at Florida Gulf Coast University.
                Though this is my first time seeking out my Bachelor's degree, I graduated from both high school and college in May of 2019, obtaining a 
                high school diploma and an Associate in Arts degree simultaneously. Since transferring to FGCU at the start of the Fall semester in 2019, I've been 
                wholeheartedly devoting myself to my studies, improving myself personally and professionally in the process. Since the start of this 
                calendar year, I've been working as a Teaching Assistant for many classes in FGCU's Mathematics department, utilizing my own 
                knowledge of math as a tool to assist in the instruction of my students. In my free time I enjoy attending Software Engineering events, 
                such as meetings for the Software Engineering Club at my college or marathon-programming "Hackathons." In fact, I attended my first 
                Hackathon in October of 2020, wherein three friends and I were able to create a piece of software that could encrypt and decrypt both 
                words and images called CipherIt! </p>
            
            <p style=text-align:left>     My primary motivation for becoming an engineer ties into a very key part of my personal identity: my own 
                disability. As someone who has been physically disabled since the age of nine, I've been working with adaptive technology for more than 
                half of my life. This very technology, along with the option of Florida Virtual School, is what made the continuation of my education 
                possible in the first place. However, I'll be the first to admit that much of this technology is out of date or simply too lacking in 
                adaptive features. Seeking the ability to change this, combined with my affinity for technology, naturally drew me into the field of 
                software engineering. Thus, my long-term goal as a software engineer is to redesign and fine-tune much of the widely-distributed, 
                education-related, adaptive software in circulation today to be more in-line with the needs of the disabled. </p>
            
            <p style=text-align:left>     Though I have a well-defined long-term goal professionally, my short-term goals are all academic. The 
                goal of the highest priority for me is to graduate college with a 4.0 GPA. As my academics have always been extremely important to me, this goal 
                is especially important to me personally. Aside from that, I also strive to improve further my skills in the Python and Java 
                programming languages, continuously improving my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming along the way. Lastly, I also hope to 
                involve myself in as many student projects as possible, making new connections with peers and professionals alike in the process.  </p>

                This work-in-progress Java-based encryption project allows the user four main options: encrypting a string of text the user inputs,
                decrypting a string of text the user inputs, encrypting an image, and decrypting an image. This project was built by a small team
                of four during the Knight Hacks 2020 hackatahon. Though this project is currently unfinished, our team of four plans to add
                several more features to make the piece of software both functional and educational. After refining the image encryption and decryption
                algorithms, we plan to add an option to allow the user to save encrypted images for later decryption. Additionally, we plan to refine
                our text log system to explain how each cipher works after a given decryption.

                    This project is a recreation of the classic Snake game, localized entirely in the console window. This C++ project served as the main
                project I worked on when I learned the language in my Programming Methodology class. The game features full collision detection on both
                the snake and the screen's boundaries, which are represented visually as white lines. Additionally, the food that allows the snake to
                grow is randomly generated within the boundaries of the game, making for a different experience evey time you play it! The project
                demonstrates knowledge of multiple fundamental programming concepts, such as pointers, pass by reference, and custom classes/headers.

            <h1><center>Summary</center></h1>
            <p>     Overall, I found this class to be unlike any other I've taken at FGCU. Through it, I was able to build
                critical analysis skills that I have been unable to hone in any of my software engineering courses so far.
                Critiquing projects such as the Play Pumps not just from a design standpoint, but from a sociocultural impact standpoint was 
                a lot of fun, and I thoroughly enjoyed such projects. As someone who is also largely into the ethical components
                of engineering, it was very interesting to see and hear my peers' thoughts and priorities on matters such as 
                global warming and the future of nanotechnologies. Additionally, though the group assignments could cause 
                much grief in scenarios where you're placed with an uncooperative group, I always felt that any given
                group I was a part of was able to respect one another on a level I've not experienced in other classes.
                Overall, I feel that the conduct involved in the exchange of ideas within this course is a skill I can
                carry over to my work as a professional in the field of software engineering.</p>

            <br>
            <p>    In this project, I felt that I was able to gain a finer appreciation for the iterative and incremental
                software design process. Both of the pieces of technology that I discussed were simply stepping stones
                on the path to a larger goal. SCANCIF was simply a tool for code analysis that pointed out vulnerabilities in
                developer code, created entirely in an effort to assist developers in improving the HTML-5 framework. Meanwhile,
                two-factor authentication was a major innovation in security that is now being used as a basis for further innovations,
                such as quantum one time password generation. While both of these projects are great achievements on their own, they go
                the extra mile by serving as model software projects that further the continuous improvement of existing tech.</p>

            <br>
            <p>     As a disabled person myself, I always make an effort to spot ways in which technology I use daily
                might be unusable for the disabled. Thus, when my team and I were discussing project ideas for a conceptual 
                project that solves a real problem, smartphones came to mind near-instantly. While smartphoens have changed
                our lives significantly over the past decade, the fact remains that many people can't experience all the 
                benefits that they provide. For example, the blind cannot navigate screens effectively and the deaf are
                unable to partake in regular phone calls. Thus, we decided that a smartphone designed for disabled people
                would be the perfect project idea. The smartphone would have advanced accessibility features such as
                speech-to-text, text-to-speech, eye-control, voice control, and more. Further, the phone would be
                support accessibility-related peripheral devices via USB, adding more functionality such as blinking lights
                depending on what the peripheral developer designed. Overall, I felt that this project both gave us a wider appreciation
                of all the technology that we're able to use daily and gave myself and my teammates a more critical eye as to
                what truly makes a product accessible.</p>

             <h1><center>Sustainability</center></h1>
             <br>
             <p>1)     The concept of the Three Pillars of Sustainability was an extremely interesting one to me. For me, the most common connection I made with the word
                 "sustainability" was solely its environmental one. However, to simplify the matter to such a degree is disingenuous. This course reminded me that 
                 sustainable efforts are not only ones that benefit the environment, but also promote economic development and social prosperity. </p>
             <br>
             <p>2)     The Play Pumps project was a stark reminder that not all well-intentioned ideas are truly sustainable. At first, I thought the idea was brilliant,
                 combining a fundamental need for water with a fun activity for children. However, while the people behind the pumps may
                 have had the best of intentions, their lack of planning led the a quick downfall for the project. This shocking lack of consideration has stuck with
                 me, serving as a reminder as to how not to handle a project. </p>
             <br>
             <p>3)     In the Climate Policy assignment, we got to take a look at sustainability-related efforts through the eyes of a politician. We were able to see
                 the motivations and justifications for some of the most common public policy mechanisms that we knew of! In doing so, I felt that I gained a 
                 greater appreciation for the efforts of city projects related to sustainability. The mechanisms presented, comprising of many projects we 
                 often don't even think about, were rather intricate in their reasoning, commanding respect for the ones who presented them in the first place.</p>
