            <p style=text-align:left>     Hi there! My name is Adam Paul, and I'm a junior Software Engineering major at Florida Gulf Coast University.
                Though this is my first time seeking out my Bachelor's degree, I graduated from both high school and college in May of 2019, obtaining a 
                GED and an Associates of Arts degree simultaneously. Since transferring to FGCU at the start of the Fall semester in 2019, I've been 
                wholeheartedly developing myself to my studies, improving myself personally and professionally in the process. Since the start of this 
                calendar year, I've been working as a Teaching Assistant for many classes in FGCU's Mathematics ath department, utilizing my own 
                knowledge of math as a tool to assist in the instruction of my students. In my free time I enjoy attending Software Engineering events, 
                such as meetings for the Software Engineering Club at my college or marathon-programming "Hackathons." In fact, I attended my first 
                Hackathon in October of 2020, wherein three friends and I were able to create a piece of software that could encrypt and decrypt both 
                words and images called CipherIt! </p>
            
            <p style=text-align:left>     My primary motivation for becoming an engineer ties into a very key part of my personal identity: my own 
                disability. As someone who has been physically disabled since the age of nine, I've been working with adaptive technology for more than 
                half of my life. This very technology, along with the option of Florida Virtual School, is what made the continuation of my education 
                possible in the first place. However, I'll be the first to admit that much of this technology is out of date or simply too lacking in 
                adaptive features. Seeking the ability to change this, combined with my affinity for technology, naturally drew me into the field of 
                software engineering. Thus, my long-term goal as a software engineer is to redesign and fine-tune much of the widely-distrubuted, 
                education-related, adaptive software in circulation today to be more in-line with the needs of the disabled. </p>
            
            <p style=text-align:left>     Though I have a well-defined long-term goal professionally, my short-term goals are all academic. The 
                goal of the highest priority for me is to graduate college with a 4.0 GPA. As my academics have always been extremely important to me, this goal 
                is especially important to me personally. Aside from that, I also strive to improve further my skills in the Python and Java 
                programming languages, continuously improving my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming along the way. Lastly, I also hope to 
                involve myself in as many student projects as possible, making new connections with peers and professionals alike in the process.  </p>
