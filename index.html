            <p style=text-align:left>     Hi there! My name is Adam Paul, and I'm a senior year Software Engineering major at Florida Gulf Coast University.
                Though this is my first time seeking out my Bachelor's degree, I graduated from both high school and college in May of 2019, obtaining a 
                high school diploma and an Associate in Arts degree simultaneously. Since transferring to FGCU at the start of the Fall semester in 2019, I've been 
                wholeheartedly devoting myself to my studies, improving myself personally and professionally in the process. Since the start of 2020,
                I've been working as a Teaching Assistant for many classes in FGCU's Mathematics department, utilizing my own 
                knowledge of math as a tool to assist in the instruction of my students. Additionally, I've also been conducting professor-supervised research
                in regards to the utilization of Machine Learning as a tool to detect emotion. This Natural Language Processing research has me actively working
                with Python and multiple lexical tools to conduct sentiment analysis. In my free time I enjoy attending Software Engineering events, 
                such as working as the Outreach Coordinator for the Software Engineering Club at my college or marathon-programming "Hackathons." In fact,
                I attended my first Hackathon in October of 2020, wherein three friends and I were able to create a piece of software that could encrypt 
                and decrypt both words and images called CipherIt! </p>
            
            <p style=text-align:left>     My primary motivation for becoming an engineer ties into a very key part of my personal identity: my own 
                disability. As someone who has been physically disabled since the age of nine, I've been working with adaptive technology for more than 
                half of my life. This very technology, along with the option of Florida Virtual School, is what made the continuation of my education 
                possible in the first place. However, I'll be the first to admit that much of this technology is out of date or simply too lacking in 
                adaptive features. Seeking the ability to change this, combined with my affinity for technology, naturally drew me into the field of 
                software engineering. Thus, my long-term goal as a software engineer is to redesign and fine-tune much of the widely-distrubuted, 
                education-related, adaptive software in circulation today to be more in-line with the needs of the disabled. I hope to utilize my
                knowledge of Machine Learning in order to do so.</p>
            
            <p style=text-align:left>     Though I have a well-defined long-term goal professionally, my short-term goals are all academic. The 
                goal of the highest priority for me is to graduate college with a 4.0 GPA. As my academics have always been extremely important to me, this goal 
                is especially important to me personally. Aside from that, I also strive to improve further my skills in the Python and Java 
                programming languages, continuously improving my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming and Machine Learning along the way. Lastly, I also hope to 
                involve myself in as many student projects as possible, making new connections with peers and professionals alike in the process.  </p>

                This Java-based encryption project allows the user four main options: encrypting a string of text the user inputs,
                decrypting a string of text the user inputs, encrypting an image, and decrypting an image. The image cipher was built from the ground-up.
                This project was built by a small team of four during the KnightHacks 2020 hackatahon.

                    This is a cumulative repository containing the most important artifacts from my Requirements Engineering and Analysis class. In this class, all
                students were asked to partner with a business in order to draft a project that fulfilled a need of said business. This meant completeing every stage
                of the Software Development Life Cycle before actual coding begins, which can be summarized as the Requirements Engineering Process. These stages were
                requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specification, and requirements validation. This project cumilated in the completion of
                the Software Requirements Specification document. For my own project, I cooperated with Earth Origins, a health foods supplier, to create the concept
                of an automated inventory system that allowed for the editing of stock, the automatic filling of stock ordering forms, and the automatic generation
                of stock reports.

                    This Java project simulates a production management system at an unnamed company. The project communicates with a database to store information
                regarding three main components of the system - products in the system, a record of their production, and the employees registered to the system.
                This project was built by me over the course of a full 16-week semester, wherein my classmates and I iteratively added to our own versions of this
                project as we learned more in our Object-Oriented Programming class. During development, I was able to learn and implement numerous new concepts to
                the project, such as lambda expressions, inheritance, interfaces, encapsulation, and recursion.

                    This project is a recreation of the classic Snake game, localized entirely in the console window. This C++ project served as the main
                project I worked on when I learned the language in my Programming Methodology class. The game features full collision detection on both
                the snake and the screen's boundaries, which are represented visually as white lines. Additionally, the food that allows the snake to
                grow is randomly generated within the boundaries of the game, making for a different experience evey time you play it! The project
                demonstrates knowledge of multiple fundamental programming concepts, such as pointers, pass by reference, and custom classes/headers.
